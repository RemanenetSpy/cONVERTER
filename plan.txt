# Business Plan: Next‑Gen Public File Converter

## 🎯 Vision
To become the most **trusted, transparent, and reproducible** online file converter — delivering everyday convenience with unique features that competitors lack.

---

## 🛑 Problem with current converters
- **Privacy concerns:** Files are uploaded to third-party servers without transparency.  
- **Generic conversions:** Most tools just wrap FFmpeg/Pandas without innovation.  
- **Hidden limits:** Free tiers restrict file size, batch processing, or speed.  
- **No reproducibility:** Users cannot re-run conversions with identical results.  
- **Quality trade-offs:** Compression often reduces fidelity without user control.

---

## 💡 Unique differentiators
1. **Recipe-based conversions**  
   - Every conversion produces a human-readable YAML recipe.  
   - Users can re-run or share recipes for reproducibility.  

2. **Quality guarantees**  
   - Automatic integrity checks (SSIM for images, schema validation for CSV/Excel, text coverage for PDFs).  
   - Fail/rollback if quality drops below threshold.  

3. **Privacy-first mode**  
   - Local/offline conversion option (desktop app or PWA).  
   - Cloud conversion only with user’s own storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive).  

4. **Chainable pipelines**  
   - Drag-and-drop workflows: e.g., “PDF → OCR → Table → CSV → Compress → Upload.”  
   - Save and reuse pipelines.  

5. **Transparency dashboard**  
   - Show speed, fidelity, and resource usage per job.  
   - Benchmark vs. competitors on sample files.  

6. **Community-driven templates**  
   - Users share recipes (e.g., “YouTube-ready video,” “Resume PDF to Word with layout preserved”).  
   - Open marketplace of conversion workflows.
