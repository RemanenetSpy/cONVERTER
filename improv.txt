Got it, Shiv — if you don’t want to use AI yet, you can still achieve **high‑quality document conversions** by relying on **native engines and open‑source libraries**. The trick is to combine them smartly and add **quality gates** so your converter feels professional without AI overhead.

## 🔧 Best Non‑AI Approaches for Document Conversion

### 📄 PDF ↔ Word / Excel / PowerPoint
- **Use native engines:**
  - **LibreOffice headless mode** (`soffice --convert-to docx input.pdf`) → free, cross‑platform, preserves layout better than most libraries.
  - **Microsoft Office COM automation** (Windows only) → perfect fidelity using Word/Excel’s own export logic.
- **Fallback libraries:**
  - `pdf2docx` (Python) → reconstructs Word layouts.
  - `PyMuPDF` → extracts text/images with coordinates for custom rebuilds.

---

### 📊 Excel ↔ PDF
- **Best fidelity:** `win32com.client` (Windows) → Excel’s native “ExportAsFixedFormat”.
- **Cross‑platform:** `openpyxl` + `reportlab` → rebuild tables with controlled layout.
- **Quality gates:** Set print areas, repeat headers, fit‑to‑page scaling.

---

### 📝 Word ↔ PDF
- **LibreOffice headless mode** → free, cross‑platform, good fidelity.
- **COM automation (Windows)** → Word’s own export engine.
- **Tips:** Embed fonts, use consistent styles (Heading, Normal) for clean mapping.

---

### 📚 PDF ↔ ePub / MOBI
- **Calibre CLI (`ebook-convert`)** → handles reflowable text and images well.
- **Tips:** Strip headers/footers before conversion, normalize fonts for e‑readers.

---

### 🗄️ CSV ↔ Excel ↔ Parquet
- **pandas + pyarrow** → schema‑preserving conversions.
- **Tips:** Validate row/column counts, preserve datatypes, add schema JSON for reproducibility.

---

### 🖼️ Document ↔ Image
- **ImageMagick** or **PyMuPDF** → render at 300 DPI for sharpness.
- **Tips:** Preserve vector graphics where possible.

---

## 🌟 Quality Boost Without AI
- **OCR preprocessing:** Use `ocrmypdf` + Tesseract for scanned PDFs.  
- **Table detection:** Camelot/Tabula for structured extraction.  
- **Validation:** Row/column counts, text coverage %, SSIM for images.  
- **Fallback strategy:** If layout fails, export plain text + images separately with a manifest.  
- **Reproducibility:** Save conversion recipes (YAML) so jobs can be re‑run identically.

---

## ✅ Takeaway
You don’t need AI to get **professional‑grade conversions**.  
- Use **Office/LibreOffice exports** for fidelity.  
- Add **open‑source libraries** for fallback.  
- Implement **quality gates** to guarantee trust.  
- Keep it **local/offline** for privacy and cost‑free operation.

👉 Do you want me to **draft a unified pipeline diagram** showing how your converter can decide: *if Office installed → use COM; else → LibreOffice; else → fallback libraries*? That would give you a clear architecture for non‑AI, high‑quality conversions.
